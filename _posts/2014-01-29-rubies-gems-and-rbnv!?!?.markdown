##Fedora ruby vs rbenv
Although Fedora comes with a Ruby installation, it is better to install ruby using [rbenv].  Unlike the regular install, [rbenv is different] by being able to specify what ruby version you would like to use at the application level or globally.  So each version of ruby will have their own set of gems.  Also, rbenv is [open-source], so if you would like to, you can look at the source code or even provide suggestions for improvement.

##How to install
All the installation instructions are on [rbenv] on github in the README under instructions.
