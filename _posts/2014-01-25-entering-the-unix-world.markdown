#How I Got Started With Fedora
-----------------------------
For most of my life I have been only a Windows user, content with the capabilities that Windows provides.  But as I continued into the field of Computer Science,  Windows Operating System just provided more and more trouble to deal with.  Finally I had the opportunity to make the switch from Windows to a linux operating system, in this case Fedora.

With a massive amount of help from [Warren Togami], the founder of the Fedora Operating System, I was able to completely redo my computer setup and have Fedora 20 as main OS.
