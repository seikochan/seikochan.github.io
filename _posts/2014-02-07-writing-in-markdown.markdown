[Markdown] \(.md\) is a plain text formatting syntax that can be parsed into html.  This means that that a file can be written in plain text using certain symbols, spacing, positioning, etc can be automatically coverted into valid html by a markdown parser.  Note that using different parsers does impact how you write your markdown.  Each one may require slightly different mardown syntax. 

 If you are like me, starting off with no idea of what markdown is, I would suggest this [markdown reference guide].  Also, there's a very good hands on [markdown tutorial] if you learn better by doing.  To start off, I would suggest making use of [Dillinger] as a means to type your markdown so that you can see exactly what it will look like once it is converted into html.
